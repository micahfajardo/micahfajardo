- <h3> <a href=""> O-List E-commerce Business Analytics </a> </h3>
📋 <i> Project Overview: </i> <br>
This project transforms 100k+ rows of raw Brazilian e-commerce data into an interactive decision-support system. By connecting a MySQL backend to Tableau, I built dahsboards that enable stakeholders to monitor customer growth and purchasing behavior, sales and revenue trends, logistics efficiency, and sellers performance. 
* **Data cleaning and wrangling:** I used Python to for data inspection and initial cleaning before uploading in MySQL. This help me develop the pipeline for the analysis and schema for merging of multiple tables in the O-List E-commerce dataset
* **Advanced Querying:** I implemented advanced functions (e.g. window functions, CTE) to create a "master dataset" for each dashboards in Tableau
* **Visualization:** Connected Tableau to MySQL to build interactive executive dashboards tracking
### 🛠️ Tools <br>
**Python**(`os`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`), **MySQL**, **Tableau**
> *Note: Some of my dashboards are still in progress*

- <h3> <a href="https://github.com/micahfajardo/clinic_database_management"> Healthcare Database Management </a> </h3>
📋 <i> Project Overview: </i> <br>
This project involved the management and analysis of a multi-table relational healthcare database. I performed various data retrieval tasks to link patient demographics with medical records, appointments, and provider data. 
* **Relational Mapping:** Managed Primary/Foreign Key relationships across five tables: `appointments`, `doctors`, `lifestyle`, `medical_records`, and `patients`.
* **Advanced Joins:** Developed optimized SQL queries using `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `INNER JOIN` to synchronize patient names with clinical metrics like heart rate and blood pressure.
* **Data Aggregation:** Utilized `GROUP BY` and `COUNT()` to generate administrative reports on doctor-patient appointment volumes.
* **Set Operations:** Implemented `UNION` statements to create comprehensive logs of all clinical interactions, ensuring no data points were missed during system audits.
### 🛠️ Tools <br>
**phpMyAdmin, XAMMP, SQL**

 - <h3> <a href=""> EDA of HCV Liver Disease Biomarkers </a> </h3>
📋 <i> Project Overview: </i> <br>
This project explores real clinical patient data collected for machine learning to validate the non-invasive staging of HCV-related liver disease progression. I performed exploratory data analysis and inferential statistics to identify biochemical markers that characterize the transition from healthy states to Hepatitis, Fibrosis, and Cirrhosis. 
* **Statistical Methodology:** Implemented ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests to validate the significance of biomarker variance across disease stages.
* **Distribution Analysis:** Utilized KDE Plots and Histograms to identify skewness and distribution of biomarkers.
* **Clustering:** Applied K-Means Clustering to identify natural patient groupings based on biomarkers activity.
### 🛠️ Tools <br>
**Python**(`os`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy.stats`, `sklearn`, `seaborn`)

 - <h3> <a href=""> Data Analysis of Clinical and Genomic Records </a> </h3>
📋 <i> Project Overview: </i> <br>
In this project, I used **R** to clean, merge, and analyze three separate databases to investigate factors influencing a specific biological metric (the VDR gene). The goal was to determine if specific data categories (Copy Numbers) showed distinct numerical trends (RNA Expression) and how these related to broad demographic groups. I used boxplots to show the associations of factors to VDR gene expression. This project uses real clinical and genomic data records. 
### 🛠️ Tools <br>
**R**(`dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyverse`, `ggpubr`, `stringr`, `rstatix`, `readr`)

<h2>🚀 Data Science Projects </h2>
 
 - <h3> <a href=""> Multi-Model Network Analysis of Early Diabetic Symptom Interdependencies </a> </h3>
📋 <i> Project Overview: </i>
This study presents a novel analysis of symptom networks for early-stage diabetes using a clinical dataset from Sylhet, Bangladesh. To address the "black-box" limitations of traditional machine learning, we mapped how individual clinical symptoms interact and cluster to drive disease progression.
* **Multi-Model Integration:** Implemented four distinct network construction frameworks—**IsingFit (LASSO)**, **CfsSubsetEval**, **BnLearn**, and **HNet**—to compare structural robustness in revealing symptom interactions.
* **Centrality & Hub Identification:** Calculated network centrality metrics (Degree, Strength, Betweenness, and Closeness) to identify influential symptoms and assess structural differences across methods.
* **Community Detection:** Applied the **Leiden algorithm** to identify clinically relevant symptom clusters (communities) that tend to occur together in Diabetes.
### 🛠️ Tools <br>
**Python** (`pandas`, `hnet`, `bnlearn`, `leidenalg`, `ucimlrepo`, `seaborn`)
**R** (`IsingFit`), and** Gephi**.

 - <h3> <a href=""> In-Silico Drug Repurposing on Chronic Liver Diseases via Network Model </a> </h3>
📋 <i> Project Overview: </i>
This study implemented a computational pipeline to identify new therapeutic uses for existing drugs to treat chronic liver diseases. I managed the end-to-end workflow from raw data extraction to final network visualization.
* **Data Extraction & Wrangling:** Developed Python scripts to retrieve and clean high-dimensional datasets.
* **Algorithm Implementation:** Utilized **R** to execute the SAveRUNNER algorithm, quantifying the proximity between disease genes and drug targets within the human interactome.
* **Visualization:** Transformed adjacency matrices into intuitive graph layouts using Gephi to map drug-disease overlaps.
### 🛠️ Tools <br>
**Python** (`pandas`, `numpy`), **R**(SAveRUNNER), **Gephi**.
